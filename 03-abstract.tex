    {
    Tridimensional reconstruction is still a challenging area, that is widely used in area like architecture and robotics. Several technologies are used today, like Stereoscopy or Structured Light, however, none is able to achieve precise geometric results, which are usually required. A technology, LiDAR, has evolved as the \textit{de facto} technology for tridimensional reconstruction, being able to achieve unmatched results. Yet, this technology is unable to register the color of objects, so the usual solution is the use a camera for this.

    Therefore, in this work we develop a set of algorithms and techniques for tridimensional reconstruction with a LiDAR laser scanner and a camera. Moreover, a 3D scanner was developed to register real-word scenes. In particular, a innovative calibration method was developed to calibrate the laser scanner, which performed above a similar calibration method, and a normal estimation method was also developed to estimate the normals faster and with similar results, in comparison to other methods. 

    Finally, six reconstruction were done to test the algorithms developed. The geometric reconstruction was very accurate but the color reconstruction was perfect, specially because of the poor calibration method of the camera.
