\chapter{Methodology for 3D Scene Acquisition}
\label{chapter:scene_capture_methodology}

This chapter describes the concepts and methodology around a capture of a scene. This methodology is split into two levels: the acquisition and the capture level. An acquisition is a collection of sensor data recorded from a specific position of the scene and a capture is a collection of acquisitions taken from the scene scene, but from different positions.

The reason behind these two level has to be because there is limited information about the scene in each acquisition. These limitations are the occlusion of different parts of the scene by objects, the hardware limitation of sensors, like the small aperture angle of the laser scanner or the field of view of the camera, and the environment factors, for example, the lightning conditions and the reflectivity of the object's surfaces. This effects are show in \cref{figure:limitations-single-acquisition}. To overcome these limitations, multiple acquisitions required, however, this also comes with some challenges, for example, how to merge all the acquisitions and how to handle the redundant data.

So, acquisitions and captures are different levels and each one has a different method and objectives. In an acquisition level, the focus is on how to operate the scanner and define how the data is recorded. In a capture level, the focus is on how to plan multiple acquisitions so a good reconstruction is possible. In the following sections, both acquisitions and captures are further explained.
