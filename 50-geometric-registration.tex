\chapter{Methodology for Geometry Reconstruction}

This chapter present the methodology to reconstruct the geometry of the scene. In \cref{section:point-registration}, the laser scans of each acquisition are transformed into point clouds. In \cref{section:laser-extrinsic-calibration}, two calibration methods, one of which was developed in this work, are described to obtain the extrinsic calibration of the laser scanner. \cref{section:normal-estimation} describes a method to estimate the normals, based on the structure of the point cloud. In \cref{section:acquisition-registration}, a method to find the transformations between acquisitions is described, to merge the acquisitions into one point cloud. Finally, in \cref{section:filters}, three point cloud filters used in this work are described.
