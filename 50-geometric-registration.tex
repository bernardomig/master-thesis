\chapter{Methodology for Geometry Reconstruction}

This chapter presents the methodology using for the reconstruction of the geometry of a scene. In \cref{section:point-registration}, the laser scans are transformed into point clouds. In \cref{section:laser-extrinsic-calibration}, two calibration methods are described to obtain the extrinsic calibration of the laser scanner to the PTU. \cref{section:normal-estimation} describes a method to estimate the normals, based on the structure of the point cloud. In \cref{section:acquisition-registration}, a method to register the multiple acquisitions is described, to merge the acquisitions into one point cloud. In \cref{section:filters}, three point cloud filters used in this work are described.
