\section{Camera Extrinsic Calibration}
\label{section:camera-extrinsic-calibration}

The extrinsic parameters of the camera the position and orientation of the camera in the robot. In this case, the camera was mounted statically on top of the PTU, just like the laser scanner. This calibration that determines this extrinsic parameters is known as the eye-in-hand calibration, described in \cite{horaud95}.
